#summary Using Escort

= Using Escort Web Browser =

Escort web browser is a new web browser which is currently under the
development as one of the ES operating system projects. 
Escort has a totally new CSS/HTML rendering engine, 
and it can be configured with 
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey SpiderMonkey] or 
[http://code.google.com/p/v8/ V8] 
!JavaScript engine over our [Cplusplus0xBinding Web IDL C++11 binding].
The user interface of Escort itself is also implemented by HTML/CSS and !JavaScript. 

*Note*: Escort Web Browser has been mainly tested on Fedora 17 at this point.

== Setup ==

http://code.google.com/p/es-operating-system/downloads/list has all the latest download items. 

With Fedora 17, Escort can be installed with yum.

=== 32-bit ===

% sudo yum localinstall [http://code.google.com/p/es-operating-system/downloads/detail?name=escort-0.2.0-1.fc17.i686.rpm escort-0.2.0-1.fc17.i686.rpm]

In the other systems, Escort needs to be built and installed from the source files. On Fedora 16, 17 and Ubuntu 12.04, you can use the [http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/setup.escort setup script].

== Starting Escort ==

== Using Escort ==

The new Escort window initially opens about:blank page:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.blank.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

There is a toolbar across the bottom of the window:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.toolbar.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

The toolbar offers the following items:

  * ES logo button
  * Back button
  * Forward button
  * Location field
  * Reload button
  * Cancel button

Clicking the ES logo button brings the about: page (with version 0.2.0):

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.about.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

There is a blue link, "Esrille Inc.", in the fourth line on the about: page.
Try clicking on the link. Now Escort tries to bring the home page of Esrille Inc.
After you click on the link, the ES logo button switches to an animating gear icon 
to show you that the page transfer is in progress:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.loading.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

When the page is completely loaded, the gear icon changes back to the ES logo icon,
and you'll see http://www.esrille.com/ in the location field:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.esrille.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

The title bar of the Escort window shows the title and favicon of the page (if the page has one):

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.titlebar.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

To bring a web page by specifying a URL, click the location field, and type,

  `http://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html`
  
which is the URL of the [http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/ Acid2] test page:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.acid2-1.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

Hit the `Enter` key to start loading the page.

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.acid2-2.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

To see the Acid2 test result, click on the blue link that reads, "Take The Acid2 Test":

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.acid2.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

At this point, Escort web browser implements [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ CSS 2.1] specification relatively well and
passes the Acid2 test.
It also passes about 90% of the tests in the [http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/ CSS2.1 Conformance Test Suite].
We're going to support recent dynamic and rich Web pages and the
[http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid3/ Acid3] test 
in the future versions of the Escort browser.

== File Organization ==

The following is the file organization of the Escort web browser installation.

{{{
/usr/bin
    + escort          # shell script that executes the browser core
/usr/libexec/esrille/escort
    + escort          # browser core (binary executable)
/usr/share/applications
    + escort.desktop  # desktop file for freedesktop.org environment
/usr/share/esrille/escort
    + escort.html     # browser UI page
    + default.css     # default style sheet
    + escort.ico      # default window icon
    + etc.            # other image files used by escort.html
/usr/share/esrille/escort/about
    + blank           # about:blank page
    + index.html      # about: page
    + etc.            # other image files used by the about URL files
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/*x*/apps
    + escort.png      # icon files used by the GUI shell
}}}

The user specific configuration files are stored in,

{{{
$HOME/.esrille/escort
}}}

This is also where Escort creates its temporary cache files.

== Escort's user agent string ==

Escort's user agent string uses the format:

{{{
Escort/x.y.z
}}}

Where *x.y.z.* provides the version number of the package (such as "0.2.0").

_Note: The format may be changed in the future versions._
